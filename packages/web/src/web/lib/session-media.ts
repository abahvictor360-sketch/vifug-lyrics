/**
 * Media that lives in the browser for one session and is never uploaded.
 *
 * The hosted app has no writable disk, so a background picture has always had
 * to go to object storage. When there is no bucket - or the bucket refuses -
 * the upload simply failed, which left the browser app unable to show a flyer
 * at all. Keeping the file in the page is the honest alternative: nothing is
 * stored anywhere, so there is nothing to configure, nothing to pay for and
 * nothing left behind.
 *
 * They are kept in the browser's own database, so a reload, a closed laptop or
 * a Monday morning does not lose the flyer someone prepared. Still never
 * uploaded, still deletable from the media library, and still invisible to
 * anything that is not this browser - an OBS source and a phone are different
 * browsers and cannot be handed a file that was never sent anywhere.
 *
 * The desktop app is unaffected. It has a real disk and writes there, which is
 * what an offline church laptop needs - a background that vanished on restart
 * would be a regression, not a feature.
