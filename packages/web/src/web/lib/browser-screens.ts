/**
 * Putting the output on a second monitor from a browser.
 *
 * The desktop app asks Electron for the displays and opens a frameless window
 * on the one it wants. A browser used to have nothing of the sort, so the
 * hosted app could only do window.open at a default size on whatever screen
 * the operator was already looking at - they then had to drag it across and
 * fullscreen it by hand, every service.
 *
 * The Window Management API closes that gap. Chrome and Edge (and Chromium
 * derivatives) can enumerate the monitors attached to the machine and open a
 * window positioned on a specific one, which is exactly what is needed. It is
 * permission-gated, because knowing how many screens someone has and where
 * they are is a real fingerprinting surface, and the prompt only appears in
 * response to a click - so this is never called on load.
 *
 * Firefox and Safari have neither the API nor an equivalent. There the honest
 * answer is a plain window the operator moves themselves, which is what they
 * had before, and the UI says so rather than offering a monitor picker that
 * cannot pick.
